// Given an unsorted array of size n.
//  Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. 
//  One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and
//   one number occurs twice in the array. Find these two numbers.

 * Naive soltuon 
 * Create an empty array of same length having zero
 * iterrate through firdt array and increase the frequency count in secon
 * time -> O(n)
 * s->  0(n)
